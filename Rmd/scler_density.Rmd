# Setup

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Set knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(lme4)
library(lsmeans)
```

# Import data

We will analyze the complete count dataset

```{r}
# Import tidy count data
load("data/all_counts.RData")
```

# Calculate coral density
```{r}
# Scleractinian count data
scler <- filter(all_counts, category == "scleractinian") %>%      # Get scleractinians only
  select(reef, dir, channel, site, site2, dist, year, date,       # Reorder columns
         transect, transect_area_m2, genus, species, count, perm)

df <- scler_dens_transect %>%

            dens.mean = mean(dens),

  facet_wrap(reef ~ dir) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", aes(group = factor(year < 2014)))
```

```{r}
# Reproduce figure 26
r2summ <- scler_dens_transect %>%
  filter(year == 2013 | year == 2015,        # subset "baseline" and post-construction
         reef == "R2",        # subset reef 2
         perm == "yes") %>%   # subset permanent sites
  group_by(site, site2, year) %>%
  summarise(n.transect = n(),
            meandens = mean(dens),
            sd = sd(dens),
            se = sd / sqrt(n.transect))


ggplot(r2summ, aes(x = site, y = meandens, fill = factor(year), group = factor(year))) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = meandens - se, ymax = meandens + se), position = "dodge")

# this looks different than figure 26. I think they may have averaged first across the three transects for each date, and then averaged across the four dates. see Table 13 "N=4" for most sites...
