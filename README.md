This work describes impacts to coral reefs surrounding the 2013-2015 dredging of the Port of Miami based on data collected before, during, and after dredging by Dial Cordy and Associates (DCA) on behalf of Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company, the dredging contractors for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and for the Port of Miami (Miami-Dade County). A front page for this repository can be accessed at [jrcunning.github.io/pom-dredge](http://jrcunning.github.io/pom-dredge) containing rendered R Markdown detailing all analyses conducted as part of this work.

#### Rmd:

*Note:* These R Markdown documents serve as records of data analysis including initial data exploration and plotting, and preliminary and intermediate analyses. As such, the labels and terminology found in some of the code and figures in these documents differ from what is presented in the final manuscript. For example, in initial analyses sites were coded as “channelside” or “control” based on the FDEP/DCA study design, but were subsequently recoded in final analyses according to distance from channel once it became clear that “control” sites were also impacted by dredging. Similarly, the benthic category “sand”, as coded by DCA, is referred to as sediment in final analyses, and the reef names also change from “Hard Bottom”, “Reef 2”, and “Reef 3” (as coded by DCA), to “Nearshore Ridge”, “Inner Reef”, and “Outer Reef”, respectively, to be consistent with published literature.
